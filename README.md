connect-arango
==============

ArangoDB session store for Connect.

##Â Notes

* Requires that database is created.

## Installation

via npm:

    $ npm install github:carlitux/connect-arango

## Options

  - `hash` (optional) Hash is an object, which will determine wether hash the sid in arango, since it's not undefined, means sid will be hashed
  - `hash.salt` Salt will be used to hash the sid in arango, default salt is "connect-arango"
  - `hash.algorithm` Hash algorithm, default algorithm is "sha1"
  - `db` An object with url and databaName fields
           `url` default to: http://localhost:8529  you can use http://user:pass@localhost:8529
  - `collection` Collection (optional, default: `sessions`)
  - `stringify` If true, connect-arango will serialize sessions using `JSON.stringify` before
                setting them, and deserialize them with `JSON.parse` when getting them.
                (optional, default: true). This is useful if you are using types that
                ArangoDB doesn't support.
  - `serialize` Custom hook for serializing sessions to arangoDB. This is helpful if you need
                to modify the session before writing it out.
  - `unserialize` Custom hook for unserializing sessions from ArangoDB. This can be used in
                scenarios where you need to support different types of serializations
                (e.g., objects and JSON strings) or need to modify the session before using
                it in your app.
  - `clear_interval` The amount of milliseconds to wait between session accesses to clear expired sessions.
  - `ttl` ttl value in milliseconds used with clear_interval

The second parameter to the `ArangoStore` constructor is a callback which will be called once the database is ready.

## Example

With express4:
    
    var session = require('express-session');
    var ArangoStore = require('connect-arango')(session);

    app.use(session({
        secret: settings.cookie_secret,
        store: new ArangoStore({
          db : settings.db,
        })
      }));

With express<4:

    var express = require('express');
    var ArangoStore = require('connect-arango')(express);

    app.use(express.session({
        secret: settings.cookie_secret,
        store: new ArangoStore({
          db: settings.db
        })
      }));

With connect:

    var connect = require('connect');
    var ArangoStore = require('connect-arango')(connect);

## Removing expired sessions

  Since ArangoDB does not have a TTL entry for documents, this is done using an AQL query in the session store.
  Every time a session is accessed, it will clear expired sessions, but only if it has passed more than `clear_interval` milliseconds (default 60 seconds)
  between each access.
